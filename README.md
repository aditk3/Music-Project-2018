# Music-Project-2018

## Inspiration
I've been really into music production since the 10th grade (you can find some of my work [here](bit.ly/aditkYT)) and due to my interest in coding, I decided to try and create my own (extremely basic) [DAW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation). I used C++ as this was the language I was learning at the time. Since this was one of my first projects, my coding style and copy-pasting large chunks of code are somethings that hurt my soul, but forgive me for that cause I promise I've become a lot better XD. All the samples were recorded by me using Ableton, and you can see the project in action over [here](https://youtu.be/ctjeUV7gCJo).

## Features
This is a console based application with 2 main parts:
  * The DAW
  * A small album store with a customer/seller login system
  
### DAW
The user is able to use his/her keyboard (typing) as a keyboard (musical) to record and save melodies to access later.
Another aspect is the ability to create chord loops and customize the duration and tempo of each of the chords.

### Album Store
A user can login either as an admin to add new "Albums" to the store and then customers can use their own logins to rent/purchase the albums, removing them from the store and placing them into the customer's hands.
