# Music-Project-2018

## Inspiration
I've been really into music production since the 10th grade and due to my interest in coding, I decided to try and create my own (extremely basic) [DAW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation). I used C++ as that was the langueage I was learning at the time, and since this was one of my first projects, my coding style and copy-pasting large chunks of code is something that hurts my soul, but forgive me for that cause I promise I've become a lot better XD. All the samples were recorded by me using Ableton, and you can see the project in action over [here](https://youtu.be/ctjeUV7gCJo).

## Features
This is a console based application with 2 main parts:
  * The DAW aspect
  * A small album store with a customer/seller login system
  
### DAW
The user is able to use his/her keyboard (typing) as a keyboard (musical) to record and save melodies to access later on.
Another aspect is the ability to create chord loops with the ability to customize the duration and tempo of each of the chords.
